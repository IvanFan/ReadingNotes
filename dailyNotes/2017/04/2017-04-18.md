## Node production env deployment

### PM2

PM2 is a famous tool to deploy node especially for express.
It includes following feature:
* Auto restart for changes
* Load balance with cluster
* Logs
* Auto start after reboot
* Remote deployment
* Auto restart with max memory
* Combined with nginx
* Combined with docker
* Monitor system (not free)

### Nginx

Nginx is a powerful web server. It can be used for load balance, reverse proxy and cluster.

Since we are using PM2 for the current project, we need to decide if nginx is required.

1. PM2 has a good support for the performance, loan balance and cluster.
2. PM2 can fully use the CPU resources.
3. Nginx can be used for reverse proxy
4. Nginx can be used for multiple servers.

Regarding the current situation, we properly need more than one server to make sure that the service is stable. Then Nginx + Pm2 is a good choice.
