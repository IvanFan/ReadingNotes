# GC of Node

When implementing the process of OCR, the node instance always has a weird memory increase. I think it's caused by the memory GC not working properly. 

In order to avoid the potential memory issue, I set the concurrency of pdf2image queue to be 1.

We can force the GC to work after queue executed

```
setTimeout(() => {
    global.gc();
    console.log(`After convert complete and GC : ${process.memoryUsage()}`);
  }, 5000);
```

To execute this command, we need to add --expose-gc into the node arguments
Since we are using pm2, we also need to figure out how to implement it with pm2.

```
pm2 start bin/www --node-args="--expose-gc" -- arg1 arg2 arg3

```

At the same time, we need to include docker into our deployemnt system.

From their document, pm2 docker supports ecosystem file.

### For local env

we add this node args into nodemon solution:

```
 nodemon({

        script: 'bin/www.js',
        ext: 'js',
        ignore: ['public/*','*.git/*','*.idea/*'],
        args:['--use_socket_server','--use_hot_reloader'],
        nodeArgs: [],
        env: {'NODE_ENV': 'development'}

    }).on('restart', []);
```

### For Production env

we need to create a pm2.json file with all config we need

```
{
  "apps": [{
    "name": "your-app",
    "script": "src/index.js",
    "node_args": "--expose-gc",
    "env": {
      "production": true
    },
    "max_memory_restart": "2G"
  }]
}

```


# Download

Browsers don't allow download request via ajax. So for the download operation, we will generate a temp download token. Therefore the user can use this token to download target document.
