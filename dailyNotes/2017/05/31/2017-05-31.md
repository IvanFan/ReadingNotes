# Research about python raspberry pi app

I'm familiar with web development and python. I'm also able to write some python script on the local. But if I want to develop a raspberry pi python application, I'm not sure what's the best practice of it.

## Cement

Cement is a framework which is designed for developing python commandline.

### Init

```python
python3 -m venv env  
 source env/bin/activate    
 pip3 freeze >> requirement.txt   
 pip3 install cement     
```

Now we have cement installed.

A quick start will be:

```python
from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

 app = CementApp('helloworld')
 app.setup()
 app.run()
 print('Hello World')
 app.close()
```

or a better way:
```python

from cement.core.foundation import CementApp

with CementApp('helloworld') as app:
    app.run()
    print('Hello World')
```

### Controller

Cement allows us to define multiple controllers for the app. Within the main.py we can register all controllers.
