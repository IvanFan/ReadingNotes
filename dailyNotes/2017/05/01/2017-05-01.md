# kubernates

A framework based on docker which can be used in production scenario.  

## Problem may have for using kubernates

### Storage

Dockers provide data volume. However, this data volume cannot be used for production env directly. It will cause a lot of issues such as data backup, data recovery and distribution data storage.  
The blog recommended a method call NAS(Network Attached Storage). The advantages of NAS are:  

* even if the application server down, we still can get the data
* nas only contains the service about storage, no application service. So it reduces the risk of server crashes

There is another term called SAN (Storage Area Network). SAN is treated as the direct connection with the server, while NAS (e.g. NFS) is a remote storage solution.  

SAN is oftern used as a disaster backup.

### Interface standard 

There should be a clear standard about infterface, such as naming, meaning and functionality.  

### Error handler

Following the standard rule to define error hander and error message

# Developer career

One of the issues for developers is that they only focus on the latest technologies such as latest frameworks, memcache, nginx load balances and distribution sys, etc. 

However, they all ignore the basic knowledge. If you don't have a good understanding about those basic knowledge, you cannot join some large companies with huge distribution system.
If you don't improve yourself, you could only work in small companies.

So relearn the knowledge about computer system, operating system, C & C++, Unix, Object oriented programming.
