# Kubernetes (2)

## Expost the Application Publicly


### Structure
```
Master  
  |_ Deployment (Multi)  = Application (Deployed)
         |_ Node (Multi)
              |_ Pod (Multi) (Internal IP) 
                   |_ Container (Multi)
```

```
Service (External IP for public)
   |_ Pod (From different nodes) (optional)

```
### Tips:

* the kubernets needs at least 3 nodes to enable the auto update function for the application.

## Scale Your Application

Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment  

Kubernetes also supports autoscaling of Pods  

Services have an integrated load-balancer that will distribute network traffic to all Pods of an exposed Deployment. Services will monitor continuously the running Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is sent only to available Pods.  

## Update Your Application
Rolling updates allow Deployments' update to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with new ones.  

## Object Management Using kubectl

There are 3 ways to manage the object
* Imperative commands (directly via commands)
* Imperative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Configuration Files (use yaml files for config)
* Declarative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Configuration Files (using config files within the repository )

Usually we should use the third one. The basic concept is to create a config file for the project with everything prepared.

### Tips 

* COPY within dockerfile only works for copying file from outside to inside. If we want to move files within the container, we need 
```
RUN cp A B
```
