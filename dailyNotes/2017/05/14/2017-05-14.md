# System Design Practice (2)


## Outline use cases, constraints and assumptions

We need to ask following questions:
* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How monay users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?


Tips: 

*Sometimes we need to do back-of-the-envelope calculation*

*Back-of-the-envelope calculations are estimates you create using a combination of thought experiments and common performance numbers to a get a good feel for which designs will meet your requirements.*

Common rules:

* Memory is fast and disk is slow (yea obviously)
* Writes are 40 times more expensive than reads (that's why we may need to spearate write db and read db)
