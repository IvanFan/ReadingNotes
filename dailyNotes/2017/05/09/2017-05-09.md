## Package Up The Image With Dockerfile

By following the tutorial, we need to first generate an independent image for production. 

Later we can use google's new fea
ture (Build triggers) to trigger the branch update and automatically build and install staging image into the container registry.  

## Entire Process to Setup Application

### Setup cluster via gcloud 

We can setup new cluster via gcloud command or via gcloud GUI  

### Login to the gcloud cluster

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-name --zone=asia-east1-a
```
