# Kubernetes (4)

## Setup controller and service

Now, we need to create a Replication Controller for the application. Because if a standalone Pod dies, it won't restart automatically.

```
# web-controller.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  labels:
    name: web
  name: web-controller
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/myapp
        name: web
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
          name: http-server
```

```
kubectl create -f web-controller.yml
```

Then we need to create a service as an interface for those pods.

This is just like the “link” command line option we used with Docker compose.

```
# web-service.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web
  labels:
    name: web
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    name: web

```

```
kubectl create -f web-service.yml
```

* The type is LoadBalancer. This is a cool feature that will make Google Cloud Platform create an external network load balancer automatically for this service!
* We map external port 80 to the internal port 3000, so we can serve HTTP traffic without messing with Firewalls.

We can use command to check pods status.

```
kubectl get pods
```
In order to find the IP address of our app, run this command:

```
$ gcloud compute forwarding-rules list
NAME     REGION        IP_ADDRESS       IP_PROTOCOL TARGET
abcdef   us-central1   104.197.XXX.XXX  TCP         us-xxxx
```
![The ideal structure](https://github.com/IvanFan/ReadingNotes/blob/master/dailyNotes/2017/05/10/1-3UUOn92G9q14-Q6OLRH9ZA.png)

So now we have two pods for the application and one web service which contains the extrenal ip.

Now we need to setup db service for our application.

MongoDB has a concept of [Replica Set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/) 


*A replica set is a group of mongod instances that maintain the same data set. A replica set contains several data bearing nodes and optionally one arbiter node. Of the data bearing nodes, one and only one member is deemed the primary node, while the other nodes are deemed secondary nodes.* 

*When a primary does not communicate with the other members of the set for more than 10 seconds, an eligible secondary will hold an election to elect itself the new primary. The first secondary to hold an election and receive a majority of the members’ votes becomes primary.*

We can follow another [blog](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/01/running-mongodb-on-kubernetes-with-statefulsets.html) to set it up

The writer create a repository to auto config the mongodb Replica Set. I forked the [repository](https://github.com/IvanFan/mongo-k8s-sidecar)

To setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/thesandlord/mongo-k8s-sidecar.git
cd /mongo-k8s-sidecar/example/StatefulSet/
kubectl apply -f googlecloud_ssd.yaml
kubectl apply -f mongo-statefulset.yaml
```



Tips:

* Be careful about the zone difference

## Rolling update

If we only need to update the container image:

```
kubectl rolling-update NAME [NEW_NAME] --image=IMAGE:TAG
```
