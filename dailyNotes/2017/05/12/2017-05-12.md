# An issue about ruby

In ruby symbol is different compared with string. You cannot directly use the string to call the attribute within on hash array.

The data type of hash array keys is symbol. Therefore, we need to convert string to the symbol to check if it's existing in the array.

```
to_sym() public
Returns the Symbol corresponding to str, creating the symbol if it did not previously exist. See Symbol#id2name.

"Koala".intern         #=> :Koala
s = 'cat'.to_sym       #=> :cat
s == :cat              #=> true
s = '@cat'.to_sym      #=> :@cat
s == :@cat             #=> true
This can also be used to create symbols that cannot be represented using the :xxx notation.

'cat and dog'.to_sym   #=> :"cat and dog"
```
