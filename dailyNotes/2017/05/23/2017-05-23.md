## Interface development for distributed services

### Cache Design
* The product data will be saved to cache (redis)
* Provide the interface for refreshing interface
* During the refreshing of redis, the front end should still have data
* Data cache should have version number. Everytime the cahce update should generate a new cache key
* Save the cache key to the list which can filter the latest verion by current time

### API Design
