# Reading Note - Interface development for getting products distributed services

## Cache Design
* The product data will be saved to cache (redis)
* Provide the interface for refreshing interface
* During the refreshing of redis, the front end should still have data
* Data cache should have version number. Everytime the cahce update should generate a new cache key
* Save the cache key to the list which can filter the latest verion by current time

## API Design

* interface parameter: version and page index
* response data: data and vurrent version
* use sortedset to get the latest version number
* the first time request will response the current latest version number
* the client will cache the version number. The next page request will need the cached version number
* return 304 if the client request the first page and local version number equal to current version number. So the client can avoid re-rendering the page
* if no version number within the request, Use the latest one

## Tips:

* infinite increase of version number: the version number will keep increasing. So we need to delete the version number of last day during update. Use sorted set to filter the version number
* when getting the latest version, capturing the version set for the last hour. Then use filter to get the latest one. When getting the data for the product, find the version number which contains the data if the product doesnot exist in current version
* SLB: Server Load Balancing

## Structure

## Summary

Factors need to be considered:
* The preformance of the interface
* The stability of the interface
* Error Tolerance 
* Server side pressure: reduce the pressure of the server side
* Service downgrade: during high pressure

# Reading Note - Cache

there is a good explaination about [multi level cache](https://www.quora.com/Computer-Architecture-What-is-the-L1-L2-L3-cache-of-a-microprocessor-and-how-does-it-affect-the-performance-of-it)

* (L1) Level 1 Cache(2KB - 64KB) - Instructions are first searched in this cache. L1 cache very small in comparison to others, thus making it faster than the rest.

* (L2) Level 2 Cache(256KB - 512KB) - If the instructions are not present in the L1 cache then it looks in the L2 cache, which is a slightly larger pool of cache, thus accompanied by some latency.

* (L3) Level 3 Cache (1MB -8MB) - With each cache miss, it proceeds to the next level cache. This is the largest among the all the cache, even though it is slower, its still faster than the RAM.

# Reading Note - Downgrade solution for distribution system

## Concept

In order to make sure the main service is still available during extreme situations such as high pressure, server error, or breaking workflow, we can design the downgrade service. The downgrade service will only provide limited services. 

The server can automatically downgrade the service regarding to key variables. We can also implement manual solution to switch on/off downgrade service.

Some services can not be downgraded.

## Category

* automatically or manually
* read service or write service
* mutiple level or single level

## Scenario

* normal: service is not stabile because of upgrade and internet. Use automatical solution
* warning: the stability range from 95% to 100%ã€‚ Use automatical solution or manual solution
* error: availablity less then 90%. It may be caused by db connection pool is full or request is too large. Use automatical solution or manual solution
* serious error:  manual solution
