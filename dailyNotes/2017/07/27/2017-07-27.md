# Quick Guide about how to setup kubernetes with kops and third-party firewall FortinetGate

## Overview
AWS has some concepts about the definition of their cloud solution. It's better to have a basic understanding about those concept before coming to the setup process.

The entire document can be divided into 3 parts:

- Basic concepts about AWS Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
- How to setup the k8s cluster on AWS with kops
- How to setup the firewall solution with FortinetGate

As a software enginer, I'm new to the area of network security. But it's exciting to build sth relevant to security from scratch. Besides, as a developer, I always want to understand all details of the new knowledge. So if you just want to setup the cluster with firewall, please directly jump to the second part of this document. If I have any misunderstanding about those technologies, please let me know. Thanks

## Basic concepts about AWS Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)

### VPC

```
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.
```
Above is the definition from AWS. In summary, VPC is a virtual network/scope pre-defined by AWS.

### Region and Availability Zone

```
Each region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between regions and Availability Zones.
```

There are many reasons of using availability zones. For example, High Availability and DMZ

### Subnet

```
A subnet is a logical division of the IP address range into smaller logical networks. 
Each subnet inside a VPC is connected to a router which routes the traffic between the different subnets in the VPC â€“ this is how you get connectivity between different subnets inside the VPC

```

OK, now it's time to do a quick review about those concepts before we go deep into more details. 
So, here is the relationship about VPC, Availability Zone and Subnet:

![subnet](https://github.com/IvanFan/ReadingNotes/blob/master/dailyNotes/2017/07/27/subnets-diagram.png)

As you can see, one aws account can have multiple VPCs. For each VPC, there maybe multiple Availability Zonez and within each zone, there maybe multiple subnets.
