# Some Java knowledge

Recently I began to use java again. It's better to review the knowledge of java and make some notes for future quick review.


## multiple inheritance

Java implements MI in a different. It allows you to implement multiple interfaces. But you can only inheirt one implementation.

C++ supports multiple inheritance.

## class oriented

## JVM

### class loader

java source (.java) will first be converted into Java byte code (.class) by Java compiler (.javac). Then the .class file will be put into class loader  

Classloader will load class into JVM.

1. Loading Strategy

JVM uses parent loading model.  
If a classloader receive a loading request, it will first assign this request to parent class loader. All loaders follow the same rule. Only when the parent loader doesn't contain any class, then the child loader will try to load it by it self.  

Why we need it?  
e.g. if some one changed the java.lang.String with some hacking code, without parent loader then JVN will use that hacking String class as the system String class.

BootStrapClassLoader is the top level classloader.

Tips for myself:  

BootStrapClassLoader。它是最顶层的类加载器，是由C++编写而成, 已经内嵌到JVM中了。在JVM启动时会初始化该ClassLoader，它主要用来读取Java的核心类库JRE/lib/rt.jar中所有的class文件，这个jar文件中包含了java规范定义的所有接口及实现。  
ExtensionClassLoader。它是用来读取Java的一些扩展类库，如读取JRE/lib/ext/*.jar中的包等（这里要注意，有些版本的是没有ext这个目录的）。
AppClassLoader。它是用来读取CLASSPATH下指定的所有jar包或目录的类文件，一般情况下这个就是程序中默认的类加载器。  
CustomClassLoader。它是用户自定义编写的，它用来读取指定类文件 。基于自定义的ClassLoader可用于加载非Classpath中（如从网络上下载的jar或二进制）的jar及目录、还可以在加载前对class文件优一些动作，如解密、编码等。  

很多资料和文章里说，ExtClassLoader的父类加载器是BootStrapClassLoader，其实这里省掉了一句话，容易造成很多新手（比如我）的迷惑。严格来说，ExtClassLoader的父类加载器是null，只不过在默认的ClassLoader 的 loadClass 方法中，当parent为null时，是交给BootStrapClassLoader来处理的，而且ExtClassLoader 没有重写默认的loadClass方法，所以，ExtClassLoader也会调用BootStrapLoader类加载器来加载，这就导致“BootStrapClassLoader具备了ExtClassLoader父类加载器的功能”。

### Runtime Data Areas

It's the memory section during runtime.  
![runtime data areas](https://github.com/IvanFan/ReadingNotes/blob/master/dailyNotes/2017/06/19/runtime.jpeg)

* Method Area

It stores structured info. E.g. constant pool, static variables constructors.

* Heap

It stores all java instances and objects. It's the main area for GC.

Tips: Method area and Heap are shared by all processes

* Stack

Once a thread has been setup, JVM will build a stack for this thread.

Foreach Stack, it contains multiple stack frame. Each function will build one java stack frame. It will save temp variables, operation stack and return value. The start and end of one function are mapping to the stack entering and stack exit.

* PC Regoster
It's used to save the memory address of current process. It can make sure that after the thread switching the process still can recover back to the previous status.

* Native Method Stack
It's similar for stack but only used for JVM native methods


## Memory assignment

JVM will first assign a huge soace and all new operation will reassign and release within this space. It reduces the time of calling system and is similar to memory pool. Secondly, it introduce the concept of GC.

* Static memory

If the memory size can be defined during compiling, it's a static memory. It means the memory is fixed. e.g. int

* Dynamic memory
Only know the memory size when executing it. e.g. object memory space

Stack, PC register and stackframe are private process. Once the process died, stackframe will be closed and memory will be released.

But Heap and method areas are different. Only during execition can we know the size of objects. So the memory of this section should be dynamic - GC

In a nut shell, the memory size of stack is fixed so there is no memory collection problem. But the memory size of heap is uncertiain so it will have a problem of GC.

### GC strategy

1. Mark-sweep

Mark all collected object and then collect. It's the basic method.

Cons: unefficient, after cleaning there will be a lot of memory fragmentation

2. Copying

Divide the space to two equal spaces. Only use one of those spaces. During GC, coping all active object to another space.
Pros: no memory fragmentation
Cons: double memory space

3. Mark-Compact

stage1: mark all refereced objects  
stage2: go through the entire heap, clean all marked objects and compress all alive objects into a block with orders

Pros: no memory fragmentation and double memory space issue

4. Generational Collection

This is the current used strategy for java GC.

It divides the objects into different generations by the life cycle: Young Generation, Old Generation and Permanent Generation.

Permanent Generation will save the class info.  Young Generation and Old Generation are closely related to GC.
