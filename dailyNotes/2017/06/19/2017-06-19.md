# Some Java knowledge

Recently I began to use java again. It's better to review the knowledge of java and make some notes for future quick review.


## multiple inheritance

Java implements MI in a different. It allows you to implement multiple interfaces. But you can only inheirt one implementation.

C++ supports multiple inheritance.

## class oriented

## JVM

### class loader

java source (.java) will first be converted into Java byte code (.class) by Java compiler (.javac). Then the .class file will be put into class loader  

Classloader will load class into JVM.

1. Loading Strategy

JVM uses parent loading model.  
If a classloader receive a loading request, it will first assign this request to parent class loader. All loaders follow the same rule. Only when the parent loader doesn't contain any class, then the child loader will try to load it by it self.  

Why we need it?  
e.g. if some one changed the java.lang.String with some hacking code, without parent loader then JVN will use that hacking String class as the system String class.


### execution engine

execute the java byte code

### Runtime Data Areas

It's the memory section during runtime.
