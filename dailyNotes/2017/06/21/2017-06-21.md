# gRPC


## Concept

The concept of gRPC is simple: reuse code from different languages

Based on this concept, the gRPC has clients which can connect with different servers and use the function predefined there.

## Pros

- Code Reuse: we always have some good lib or sdk in different languages
- Easy to use: with office docker support, it's kind of easy setup...
- Standard: gRPC uses protobuffer as the standard interface schema

## Cons

- Limit of languages: it doesn't support php server...
- Limit of framework: you can not use those famous framework on the server side
