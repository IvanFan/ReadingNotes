# System Design for the POS and Accounting package solution

## Technology Selection

* Main application: Django (Python)
* Micro Services for Xero, Myob and Quickbooks (Accounting solution)
* Inpos SOAP (thrid party web service)
* Web component UI mock up (from designer)
* Micro Services for POS solutions (Inpos and revel in the future)
* Vue.js and Vuex
* Docker
* Data structure regarding the UI
* Kubernetes


## Rough Structure

* Web Application for user dashboard (all settings and reports)
* Queue for transaction services (getting data from POS)
* Queue for accounting services (pushing data to accounting package)
* Transaction service will call Revel, Inpos and other pos solutions as separate micro services
* Accounting service will call Xero, Myob and Quickbooks as separate micro services
