## Problem may have for using kubernates

### Storage

Dockers provide data volume. However, this data volume cannot be used for production env directly. It will cause a lot of issues such as data backup, data recovery and distribution data storage.  
The blog recommended a method call NAS(Network Attached Storage). The advantages of NAS are:  

* even if the application server down, we still can get the data
* nas only contains the service about storage, no application service. So it reduces the risk of server crashes

There is another term called SAN (Storage Area Network). SAN is treated as the direct connection with the server, while NAS (e.g. NFS) is a remote storage solution.  

SAN is oftern used as a disaster backup.
